ISCS 210 Python Program
Filename: CP04_MathQuiz_Haskell_C
Description of the program:
Write a program that administers simple math quizzes. 
The program should display two random numbers that are to be added, such as:

247 + 129

The program should allow the student to enter the answer to the quiz. 
Your program should compare the numbers added to the studentâ€™s answer.
If the answer is correct, a message of congratulations should be displayed.
If the answer is incorrect, a message showing the correct answer should be 
displayed.

Algorithm:
Input: Prompt the user to input the answer to the question 

Processing: Generate two random numbers (rand.int) and find the sum
determine if the inputted answer is correct 


Output: Display congratulations for a correct answer, display incorrect
and the correct answer if the the answer is wrong
